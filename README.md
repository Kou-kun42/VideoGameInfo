# VideoGameInfo

This is an app used to quickly find general information about video games by searching using a name. The app uses the queried keyword(s) and then scrapes game information from popular sites like metacritic.com, howlongtobeat.com. wikipedia.com, and google.com. The information is then organized and listed in an easy to read format.

This app is deployed here:
https://videogameinfo.herokuapp.com/

However, the deployment does not work. I think this is due to one of my webscrapers which uses selenium to automate typing into a website. The app works well on a local build, but I will need to figure out how to get it to work on heroku in the future.
