# VideoGameInfo

This is an app used to quickly find general information about video games by searching using a name. The app uses the queried keyword(s) and then scrapes game information from popular sites like metacritic.com, howlongtobeat.com. wikipedia.com, and google.com. The information is then organized and listed in an easy to read format.
